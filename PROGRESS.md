# Progress

Update this at the end of every Claude Code session.

## Phases
- [ ] 1. Rules spec, then engine (with tile viewer showing settlements grow)
- [ ] 2. Agent interface
- [ ] 3. Contact (3a messaging, trade, caravans, diffusion; 3b two LLM civs, close together)
- [ ] 4. Five civs, natural contact
- [ ] 5. Conflict and the record (5a treaties/raids, 5b Chronicler/replay)
- [ ] 6. Viewer v1 (city view, time scrubber, all panels)
- [ ] 7. Experiments, research and case study

## Decisions made
- Same model (Haiku 5.5) for all rulers, different cultures plus engine-enforced modifiers
- Calls go through the Claude plan login, not a paid API key
- Whole repo is public except secrets, voice.md, private/ and runs/
- Experiments: 5 arms each, 5 seeds per arm
- Temperament dial sets starting reputation and prompt self-description only; no engine bonus of its own
- No world leader: engine + read-only Chronicler; operator is "Providence"
- Normal language from first contact
- Runs on the operator's Claude plan; campaign-style resumable play
- Research and case study are written by the operator; Claude supplies evidence packs and draft tables
- v1 tech tree cut to 21 nodes over three eras; gunpowder, banking, steam, railways, telegraph and ships are v2
- docs/rules.md approved 2026-11-10, after one opus review round; PLAN.md patched for its 14 departures
- Outposts 7 to 9 tiles from the capital; default allocation, quirk effects and rule readings in rules.md section 21 (approved 2026-11-10)

## Open numbers (tuned by Phase 1 and Phase 4 tests)
- Run-out schedule (rules 4.7): starting stocks and small-node sizes
- Tech pace (rules 14): era costs
- Contact timing (rules 6): start spacing, outpost placement, scout move; map may grow to 80 x 80

## Phase 1 milestones
- [x] M1 foundations: config, intmath, rng, state, ledger, CI, ADR 0001
- [x] M2 worldgen: spaced capitals, home regions, nodes, outposts, town traits
- [x] M3 economy tick: production with worker allocation, consumption, upkeep, growth, starvation, stability, unrest, secession, Providence and quirk events (75 tests)
- [ ] M4 tech, buildings, settlements
- [ ] M5 units, sight, contact detection, standing orders
- [ ] M6 bots, runner, snapshot, tuning tests
- [ ] M7 viewer

## Found in M3
- With no bot building anything, every civ dies out by about tick 100 on seed 1: stone runs out, upkeep goes unpaid, farms become ruins, then everyone starves. Rules 4.7 expects a decline to what the land supports, not extinction. This gets checked again with scripted bots in M6 before any number changes.
- Worldgen places no fishing grounds, so fishing produces nothing yet.

## Next session
M4: techs.py, the build queue, placement, territory growth and stage changes.
